## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to turn publicly available weather and grid data into actionable, household-level carbon reductions by estimating marginal emissions and recommending low-disruption load shifting.
<br>

This objective is achieved through the development of
1. A pipeline to process and combine public weather and grid data (demand and emissions).
2. A methodology for estimating location and time specific marginal emission factors.
3. An optimisation module that uses the specific emission factors to recommend low-disruption, but impactful load shifting to reduce emissions.

<br>

Though this project was developed on data covering households in Delhi and Mumbai, India, the methodologies and framework established here could be applicable to regions around the globe.

<br>

## Project Context

Marginal emissions are an important concept when evaluating the carbon impact of electricity usage, and they differ from the better known and more widely used average emissions. Average emissions tell you the carbon intensity of all electricity generated over some period, while marginal emissions tell you the carbon intensity of the next unit of electricity (or the last unit avoided). When evaluating the specific impacts of electricity usage in a given time and location, marginal emissions become much more relevant.

<br>

<details>
<summary><strong>Average Emissions</strong></summary>
<br>

**Definition:** The emissions associated with *all* of the energy sources that have been used to produce electricity over a given time period.
<br>

**Example:** Say over the course of a day, 100 kWh of electricity was produced from a solar farm, 200 kWh from a coal plant, and 500 kWh from a gas plant. Each of these energy sources has a specific emissions factor, which represents the amount of CO2 emitted per kWh of electricity generated. The average emissions associated with the total 800 kWh consumed would be the weighted average of the emissions factors for each source of energy, based on how much each contributed to the total.
<br>

See the [emission factors](/core_concepts_and_definitions.md) for more detail.

<br>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Marginal Emissions</strong></summary>
<br>


**Definition** The emissions associated with the *next* X amount of electricity consumed (or not consumed), and the energy source that supplies this demand.
<br>

**Example:** Assume that on a daily basis my house consumes 12 kWh of electricity. If I were install an air conditioning unit which consumes on average 9 kWh per day, the local grid  would need to find an energy source which could supply that additional energy when I turn on the AC. Then depending on the sources already being used to generate electricity and operational constraints, this additional demand may result in more coal or gas being burned in an already operating generator, or a new generator(s) switched on to meet the demand. The emissions associated with these energy needed to supply that next 9kWh specifically are the marginal emissions and the impact of that specific action.
<br>

**Additional Notes:**
* *Marginal Emissions and Generator Capacity*: The marginal supply is not always a brand-new unit turning on. Sometimes the cheapest feasible response is to ramp up an alreadyg-running generator from say 50% to 80% output; other times its' starting another unit. Because generator's heat rates (fuel per kWh) can improve or worse with the load, the marginal emissions per kWh can be higher or lower than the average at that moment. Transmission limits, renewable curtailment, and start-up/ramping costs can also shift which unit is marginal. That’s why marginal and average emissions often diverge—and why timing matters. ([AMPS](https://www.amps.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/AMPS-Guidance-for-determination-of-thermal-input-power-of-generators-.pdf))
* *Why “unexpected vs. expected” demand matters*. Grid operators plan most generation day-ahead. Marginal emissions describe the incremental adjustment relative to that plan when your behavior changes (using more, less, or shifting in time). That’s the quantity optimization tries to influence.

## Methodology - Marginal Emission Factor Estimations


### This project’s approach

This project estimates national marginal emissions factors (MEFs) for India using a generalized additive model (GAM) with a smooth in net load (Q) and smooths for weather, plus simple linear/time controls.
The GAM model was chosen because operationally useful MEFs need not only strong level fit so the model tracks the data, but also stable derivatives so ∂CO₂/∂Q behaves sensibly across regimes.
Smooth GAMs let us learn curvature in dispatch without the wiggle of global polynomials or the edge jumps of binning, yielding stable, monotone-ish marginal effects after light regularization.
We also calibrate the model’s marginal effects so they match the realized slope from short-horizon ramps (units-aligned MEFs).


<br>
<br>


**The core equation for this model can be written as follows:**

```math
Y \;=\; \beta_0 \;+\; f_Q\!\big(Q_{\mathrm{std}}\big)
     \;+\; f_T(T) \;+\; f_W(W) \;+\; f_S\!\big(\log(1+S_{\mathrm{raw}})\big)
     \;+\; \mathbf{x}_{\text{lin}}^{\top}\boldsymbol{\beta} \;+\; \varepsilon
```

Where:
* \$Y\$ is tons of \$\mathrm{CO}\_2\$ emitted in the interval.
* \$Q\_{\mathrm{std}}\$ is standardized net load: \$Q\_{\mathrm{std}} = (Q\_{\mathrm{raw}}-\mu\_Q)/\sigma\_Q\$.
    * net load in this case is demand minus renewable generation.
* \$f\_Q,f\_T,f\_W,f\_S\$ are smooth terms learned by pyGAM (splines with curvature penalties).
* \$\mathbf{x}\_{\text{lin}}\$ are linear/context features: hydro_share, wind_dir_sin, wind_dir_cos, is_sunny, doy_sin, doy_cos, hour_sin, hour_cos, is_weekend.
* \$\varepsilon\$ is the error term.


And the **Penalized objective** (second-derivative smoothing to stabilize the ME) is :

```math
\min \sum_{i}\Big(y_i - \beta_0 - f_Q(q_{i}) - f_T(T_i) - f_W(W_i) - f_S(S_i) - \mathbf{x}_{i}^{\top}\boldsymbol{\beta}\Big)^2
\;+\; \lambda_Q\!\int \!\big(f_Q''\big)^2 + \lambda_T\!\int \!\big(f_T''\big)^2
\;+\; \lambda_W\!\int \!\big(f_W''\big)^2 + \lambda_S\!\int \!\big(f_S''\big)^2 .
```

With the following hyperparameters used in the final run:
* $f_Q$: `n_splines=20`, $\lambda_Q=50$ (prioritize a smooth derivative).
* Weather smooths (T, W, S): `n_splines=20`, $\lambda=50$ each.
* Linear/time features as listed above.


<br>
<br>

When calculating the marginal emissions factor (MEF), we take the derivative of the model with respect to the standardized net load. This follows the model:

```math
\widehat{\mathrm{ME}}
\;=\;
\frac{\partial \widehat{Y}}{\partial Q_{\mathrm{raw}}}
\;=\;
\frac{1}{\sigma_Q}\,
\frac{\partial \widehat{Y}}{\partial Q_{\mathrm{std}}}
```

Which then leads to the finite-difference approximation used in code:

```math
\frac{\partial \widehat{Y}}{\partial Q_{\mathrm{std}}}
\;\approx\;
\frac{\widehat{Y}(Q_{\mathrm{std}}+h)-\widehat{Y}(Q_{\mathrm{std}}-h)}{2h}
\qquad (h\ \text{small})
```

<br>
<br>

In order to validate and calibrate the model, we use the following approaches:

**Short-horizon ramp pairs (validation targets)**

```math
s \;=\; \frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta Q},
\qquad
m \;=\; \frac{\widehat{\mathrm{ME}}_{t}+\widehat{\mathrm{ME}}_{t-1}}{2}
```

**Linear calibration (unit alignment)**

```math
s \;\approx\; a \;+\; b\,m
\quad\text{(WLS with weights }|\Delta Q|\text{)}
```

```math
\widehat{\mathrm{ME}}_{\text{cal}} \;=\; a \;+\; b\,\widehat{\mathrm{ME}}
\qquad\text{(chosen: } a \approx -0.583,\; b \approx 2.226\text{)}
```

<br>
<br>

Finally, we aggregate per-city MEFs to a **national** time series (median across cities at each timestamp). We assign a confidence label by mapping the national ramp magnitude $|\Delta Q|$ at that timestamp to the expected Pearson correlation between realized slopes $s=\Delta Y/\Delta Q$ and the model’s ME, estimated from validation ramp-pair diagnostics.


The aggregation can be written as:

```math
\widehat{\mathrm{ME}}_{\text{nat}}(t)
\;=\;
\mathrm{median}_{c}\Big\{\widehat{\mathrm{ME}}_{\text{cal}}^{(c)}(t)\Big\}
```

And the confidence label is assigned based on the correlation:

```math
r(\tau) \;=\; \mathrm{Corr}\!\big(s,\, m \,\big|\, |\Delta Q| \ge \tau\big)
```

* Where each timestamp’s local ramp \$|\Delta Q|(t)\$ is mapped to an expected \$r\$
* This is labeled as **low/medium/high** using target cutoffs (e.g., \$r!\approx!0.40/0.60\$).
<br>

<details>
<summary>Benefits of this approach</summary>
<br>

☑️ **Efficacy**:
* Produces stable MEFs across regimes due to smoothness with units-aligned via calibration.
* Reduces confounding by using weather features as proxies for both demand (heating/cooling) and renewable output (solar/wind); and by including month/hour fixed effects that absorb strong diurnal/seasonal cycles and routine operating patterns.
* Yields more stable MEF estimates by using a quadratic fit in load $Q$ and using the local derivative within each bin.

☑️ **Simplicity**:
* Uses a small set of widely understood signals—demand, emissions, and weather—keeping data needs low and the method accessible to non-experts.


☑️ **Transparency**:
* Provides clear visibility into the model's workings and assumptions with its inspectable smooths and clear calibration step

</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary>Limitations of this approach</summary>
<br>

* Estimates are directional and order-of-magnitude accurate, and should not be interpreted as exact causal effects.
* Residual endogeneity can remain (unobserved outages, transmission congestion, net imports/exports, fuel price shock)
* Less accurate than more complex models that explicitly ingest net imports, renewable curtailment, and network constraints (e.g., dispatch/hybrid approaches).
* Rank correlations improve with ramp size and are **modest overall** (typ. ≤ \~0.55–0.6 at high ramps).
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary>Additional models explored</summary>
<br>

This approach began by following an example created by Dr. Shefali Khana in the [margE_India.Rmd](/emission_rate_methodologies/marginal_emissions/margE_India.Rmd) file, which used a binned regression approach. This approach stratified observations into quantile bins based on local weather conditions (solar irradiance and wind speed). Then within each bin, emissions (tons of CO2)  were regressed on electricity demand (and demand^2 - both in MW), while fixing the effects of temporal variables month and hour.

While the original model produced a high R2, the pearson r was relatively low, indicating that the model may not fully capture the underlying relationships.

To explore other possibilities, we first performed feature engineering to create a more informative set of predictors. We then tested several alternative modeling approaches, performing bootstrapping checks to assess their stability and robustness.

The results can be summarised as follows:
* **Ridge with polynomial bases**
    * Fast, great level $R^2$, analytic derivative, but the global polynomials imposed shape everywhere, leading to wiggly ME at small–medium ramps and ME $r$ typically \~0.02–0.03 lower than QGAM.

* **Huber regression (poly features)**
    * Improved level robustness vs OLS when tails are heavy, but still inherited polynomial wiggle and sometimes attenuates the ME amplitude.

* **Groupwise OLS (binning/piecewise)**
    * Weakest level fit overall the ME ranks looked decent only at very large ramps.

More details on these models can be found in the [code_and_analysis](/code_and_analysis) section.

<br>

### Other Approaches to Emissions Estimation

<details>
<summary><strong>Traditional Approach: Full Dispatch Modelling:</strong></summary>
<br>

**What is Dispatch Modelling?**
* Grid operators schedule and dispatch generators by solving a (often mixed-integer) optimisation that respects fuel costs, ramp rates, start-up/shut-down constraints, transmission limits, reserves, and more. If you can run that model twice—baseline vs. “+Δ load”—the emissions difference divided by Δ load is the marginal emission factor.

<br>

**Benefits**
* **Accuracy:** Since the model is grounded in the physical and operational realities of the grid, it is by nature robust and with complete data, can be extremely accurate for the modeled system and quantity. This allows it to make causal inferences of emissions impacts from changes in load or generation at high temporal and spatial resolutions. In other words, you can know what electricity came from what specific generator at any time of day.

<br>

**Disadvantages**
* **Data:** Of course this approach requires a significant amount of data. We stated above that the optimisation respects the fuel costs, constraints, ramp rates, etc., but what does that mean in practice? It means you need access to detailed operational data allowing you to answer questions such as: Which power plants are online? How many generators of which type are at that power plant? What % of full capacity are these generators running at? What is their fuel source? How far away are they from the electricity demand (customers)? Can the transmission lines between the closest energy source and the destination sustain the extra load or does a different source need to be found that is maybe farther away? Is there staff available to service these systems if manual intervention is required?
* **Data Processing/Integration:** Since this data comes from many different sources coalescing it into a unified format for analysis can be challenging and time-consuming. Additionally the challenges that come with master data management and buy in from data owners will add significant complexity.
* **Proprietary Nature:** Much of the data required for this approach is proprietary and not publicly available, making it difficult for external stakeholders such as researchers to access the information they need. While governmental agencies often provide related data that can be used to build rough dispatch models, this approach still requires significant data processing, and then also becomes subject to more assumptions and limitations to fill in gaps.
* **Computational Burden:** The computational resources required to run these models can be substantial, particularly as the scale and complexity of the grid increases.
* **Reproducibility:** Due to the specific data and assumptions used in each model, reproducing results across different studies or regions can be challenging.

<br>
<details>
<summary><strong>Emerging Appproaches and Existing Research</strong></summary>

<br>
Because full dispatch models are less accessible to external users, researchers have explored empirical and hybrid approaches that approximate marginal emissions using public signals, validation experiments, and targeted structure.
One organisation in particular, [WattTime](https://www.watttime.org/), has done a great job not only developing models but sharing their methodology.

<br>
**Some approaches from their website**:

* *Difference model*
    * Take the ratio of changes across consecutive intervals (Δemissions / Δload across adjacent timesteps).
    * Pros: Extremely simple, highly granular.
    * Cons: High bias when other conditions move with load (e.g., solar rising with load); very noisy when load changes slowly.
        * Completely abandoned in 2014.

* *Binned regression model*
    * Partition history into similar grid conditions bins (hour, season, load level, etc.) and regress emissions on load within each bin. The slope is the MEF for that state.
    * Pros: Much lower bias than simple differencing, and is widely used in academia and by operators (e.g., ISONE/EPA variants).
    * Cons: Still biased if bins miss key confounders (renewables, net imports).
        * Not exclusively used since 2017, but used in combination with other techniques.

* *Heat-rate model*
    * Use locational-marginal pricing and fuel prices to determine what heat rate corresponds to what fuel type and then calculate the marginal emissions.
    * Pros: Highly granular and can capture high variability when one fuel type dominates.
    * Cons: Loses effectiveness when multiple fuel types are present.

* *Experiment-based model*(RCTs & quasi-experiments)
    * Use randomly controlled trials or quasi-random natural experiments to measure emissions response and calculate marginal emissions factors
    * Pros: They provide a good estimate of the [average treatment effect](/core_concepts_and_definitions.md) and have extremely low bias
    * Cons: Low statistical power as they are very specific to the conditions of their experiment, and have difficulty generalising to different conditions. Also require large amounts of data.

* *Marginal Unit Emissions model*
    * Use the grid’s price-setting unit’s emissions rate as the MEF. So if the grid operator uses coal to set the marginal price, the emissions rate of the coal plant would be used as the MEF.
    * Pros: highly intuitive and easy to implement.
    * Cons: Makes use of plants average emissions, and the price setter is not necessarily the demand provider. Only really valid for small shifts if at all. The data is often not public or easily accessible.

* *Hybrid Models (WattTime's Preference)*
    * What they are: Combinations of the methodlogies described above.
    * What they're currently exploring: a multi-stage, grid-conditioned model: regressions within binned “grid states” infer which fuels are marginal, separate CEMS-based regressions estimate fuel-specific marginal intensities, and a curtailment module flags when renewables would not be used.

## Methodology - Optimisation

Using the marginal emission factors generated from the GAM  model, this project then uses a constraint-aware [greedy](/core_concepts_and_definitions.md) scheduler that shifts load only when it lowers CO₂ and respects real-world limits and customer behavior.
<br>
This algorithm can be represented as maximising the total emissions reduction with respect to constraints in the following equation:

```math
\max_{q \ge 0}\; R
\;=\;
\sum_{i}\sum_{t}\sum_{s}
\big(\mathrm{MEF}_t - \mathrm{MEF}_s\big)\, q_{i,t\to s}
```

Where:
* $R$ is the total emissions reduction achieved by shifting load
* $i$ is the index for households (customers)
* $t$ is the index for source time slots
* $s$ is the index for destination time slots
* $q_{i,t\to s} \ge 0$ is the amount energy shifted for household $i$ from source slot $t$ to destination slot $s$
* $\mathrm{MEF}_t$ is the marginal emissions factor at time slot $t$
* $\mathrm{MEF}_s$ is the marginal emissions factor at time slot $s$
* $\sum_{i}\sum_{t}\sum_{s}$ is the sum across all households and time slots pairs as allowed within the constraints defined.


Note that $MEF_t$ and  $MEF_s$  are the factor rates (measured in gCO₂/kWh), but when multiplied by $q_{i,t\to s}$ (in kWh), they give the total emissions impact (in grams of CO₂) for that shift.

<br>

### What are the constraints?

The configurable constraints developed for this project are categorised in the tables below:

<br>

| **Customer Behavior Focused Constraints**    |    **Description & Rationale** |   **Parameters Used** |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------| ---------------- |
| Maximum Shifts per Customer per Day     |       Limit number of slot shifts per customer in a day in order to avoid significant disruption to their routine | 1 |
| Maximum Shifts per Customer per Week      |       Limit number of slot shifts per customer in a week in order to avoid significant disruption to their routine | 3 |
| Maximum Shift Time Window     |       Limit the time window for each shift to avoid excessive disruption | 2 hour |
| Maximum Shift out of Peak Hours     |       Limit shifts that move usage out of peak hours to avoid disruption to routine | 25% |

<br>

| **Feasibility Focused Constraints**    |    **Description & Rationale** |   **Parameters Used** |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Minimum Usage per Slot     |       Ensure a minimum level of usage in each time slot to represent always-on loads in a household | 10% |
| Maximum Shift Percentage per Slot     |       Limit the number of shifts that can be put into a single slot | 25% |
| Maximum Regional Shift Percentage per Day     |       Limit the maximum percentage of a region's total load that can be shifted in a day |   10%


<br>

### Constraint Equations
<br>
<details>
<summary><strong>Conservation of Energy </strong></summary>
<br>

The total energy consumed by each customer before and after shifting must remain the same over the course of a day. This is represented by two equations.
<br>

1. For any slot involved in a shift - the new usage at this time slot must equal the baseline usage minus any energy shifted out of that slot plus any energy shifted into that slot.
    * $\quad x_{i,t} = b_{i,t} - \sum_{s} q_{i,t\to s} + \sum_{u} q_{i,u\to t}$

2. The total energy consumed by each customer over all time slots must equal their total baseline usage over all time slots.
    * $\quad \sum_{t} x_{i,t} = \sum_{t} b_{i,t}$


Additionally, a negative consumption value does not make physical sense in this context, as it would imply that a customer is consuming less energy than their baseline usage, which is not possible. Therefore, we must ensure that all post-shift usage values are non-negative.
* $\quad x_{i,t} \ge 0 \qquad \forall i, t$


Where
* $x_{i,t}$ is the post-shift usage for customer $i$ at time $t$
* $b_{i,t}$ is the baseline usage for customer $i$ at time $t$
* $\sum_{s} q_{i,t\to s}$ is the total energy shifted *out* of slot $t$ to any destination $s$ for customer $i$
* $\sum_{u} q_{i,u\to t}$ is the total energy shifted *into* slot $t$ from any source $u$ for customer $i$

<br>
</details>


<details>
<summary><strong>Ensure Valid destinations (mask)</strong></summary>
<br>

To prevent errors or unreasonable results, shifting into infeasible time slots (e.g. missing/invalid MEF data) is not allowed:
* $\quad q_{i,t\to s} = 0\quad \text{if} \quad s \notin \mathcal{V}$

Where
* $\mathcal{V}$ is the set of valid destination time slots.
* $q_{i,t\to s}$ is the energy shifted for customer $i$ from source slot $t$ to destination slot $s$.

<br>
</details>


<details>
<summary><strong>Maximum Regional Shift Percentage per Day</strong></summary>
<br>

The total amount of energy shifted in a day is limited to a percentage of the average daily load for the region (provided by user) in order to avoid overloading the grid with many changes.
* $\quad \sum_{i}\sum_{t}\sum_{s} q_{i,t\to s}\le P \cdot L_{\text{avg}}^{\text{city,day}}$

Where
* $\sum_{i}\sum_{t}\sum_{s} q_{i,t\to s}$ is the total amount of energy shifted in the city for the day
* $q_{i,t\to s}$ is the amount of energy shifted from time slot $t$ to time slot $s$ for customer $i$
* $P \in [0,1]$ is maximum shift fraction (e.g. 0.10 for 10%)
* $L_{\text{avg}}^{\text{city,day}}$ is the average daily load for the city (kWh)

<br>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Maximum Shift out of Peak Hours</strong></summary>
<br>

The amount of energy that can be shifted out of a time slot in a peak hour is limited to a fraction $Z$ of the usage in that slot. This cap on reduction is represented by the following equation::
* $\quad \sum_{t\in h} \sum_{s} q_{i,t\to s}\le Z \sum_{t\in h} b_{i,t}\qquad \forall i, h \in \mathcal{H}_i$

Where:
* $\sum_{t\in h}$ is for all time slots $t$ in the peak hour $h$
* $\sum_{q_{i,t\to s}}$ is the total energy shifted *out* of slot $t$ to any destination $s$ for customer $i$
* $Z\in [0,1]$ is the maximum fraction of energy that can be shifted out of a peak hour (e.g. 30%)
* $b_{i,t}$ is the baseline usage for customer $i$ at time $t$
* $\mathcal{H}_i$ is the set of peak hours for customer $i$


<br>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Maximum Shift Percentage per Slot</strong></summary>
<br>

To avoid shifting all usage to the slot with the lowest MEF, a city-level spike-cap prevents the aggregate increase in a destination slot from exceeding a defined level above its baseline:
* $\quad \sum_{i}\big(x_{i,s}-b_{i,s}\big)\le{cap}^{\text{city}}_{s}\qquad \forall s$

Where:
* $x_{i,s}$ is the post-shift usage for customer $i$ at time slot $s$
* $b_{i,s}$ is the baseline usage for customer $i$ at time slot $s$
* ${cap}^{\text{city}}_{s}$ is the allowed aggregate uplift at slot $s$ (e.g.$alpha$ = 0.24 for a +25% cap vs. baseline).

<br>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Maximum Shifts per Customer per Day</strong></summary>
<br>

Limit how many shifts a customer may be 'requested' to do per day to avoid disruption:
* $\quad \bigl\lvert \{ t :\  \sum_{s} q_{i,t\to s} > 0 \} \bigr\rvert \le K_{\text{day}}\qquad \forall i \text{   (per day)}$

Where:
* $K_{\text{day}}$ is the maximum number of shifts allowed per customer per day
* $t$ is the time slot being considered for a shift
* $\sum_{s} q_{i,t\to s}$ is the total energy shifted *out* of slot $t$ to any destination $s$ for customer $i$
* The $\lvert \cdot \rvert$ notation denotes the cardinality (i.e., the number of elements) of the set inside.

<br>
This is enforced algorithmically in the greedy scheduler (cardinality constraint).

<br>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Maximum Shifts per Customer per Week</strong></summary>
<br>

Limit how many shifts a customer may be 'requested' to do per week to avoid disruption:
* $\quad \bigl\lvert \{ t :\  \sum_{s} q_{i,t\to s} > 0 \} \bigr\rvert \le K_{\text{week}}\qquad \forall i \text{   (per week)}$

Where:
* $K_{\text{week}}$ is the maximum number of shifts allowed per customer per week
* $t$ is the time slot being considered for a shift
* $\sum_{s} q_{i,t\to s}$ is the total energy shifted *out* of slot $t$ to any destination $s$ for customer $i$
* The $\lvert \cdot \rvert$ notation denotes the cardinality (i.e., the number of elements) of the set inside.

<br>
Also enforced procedurally by the scheduler similar to the daily limit.

<br>
</details>


<details>
<summary><strong>Minimum Threshold for Customer</strong></summary>
<br>

To represent always-on loads in a household, a minimum usage threshold is defined to be the greater of two values for each customer over a defined historical period: the minimum usage recorded for a timeslot and a fraction (user-defined) of the customer's robust maximum usage recorded for a timeslot. This floor is calculated as:
* $\quad f_{i,t} = \max({\underline{b}^{(z)}_{i} \quad , \quad R \cdot [p]})$


Where:
* $\underline{b}^{(z)}_{i}$ is the minimum usage recorded for customer $i$ over the historical period $z$
* $[p] = \mathrm{robustMax}^{(z)}_{i}(q)\quad$ the robust maximum usage defined by quantile $q$ recorded for customer $i$ over the historical period $z$
* $R$ is the user-defined fraction of the robust maximum usage

</details>


<details>
<summary><strong>Minimum Usage per Slot</strong></summary>
<br>

Whenever a energy is shifted out of a time slot, the post-shift usage must remain above a certain threshold to preserve essential consumption:
* $\quad x_{i,t}  \ge   f_{i,t} \qquad \forall i,t$

Where:
* $x_{i,t}$ is the post-shift usage for customer $i$ at time $t$
* $f_{i,t}$ is the minimum usage threshold for customer $i$ at time $t$

<summary><strong>Shift Time Window</strong></summary>
<br>

Any proposed shifts can only move energy to a time slot that is within a defined range relative to the original slot (e.g. +/- 2 hours).

This can be represented by the following equations:
* $\quad q_{i,t\to s} = 0 \quad \text{if} \quad |t-s| > W$

Where:
* $W$ is the maximum shift window (in time slots) allowed for each shift (e.g. +/- 2 hours with 30 minute slots $\Rightarrow W=4$ time slots).

## Data

As much of the data used in this project proved to be too large to share via traditional means, it has been stored in a OneDrive folder, accessible only to persons associated with Imperial College London. This folder and its contents can be accessed at this link: [https://imperiallondon-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/dbk24_ic_ac_uk/EglBc1C9QH1GjtNIzKmcWD4BkxFSc1SBEoBQtbS1zeKQ_g?e=YeRzvf](https://imperiallondon-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/dbk24_ic_ac_uk/EglBc1C9QH1GjtNIzKmcWD4BkxFSc1SBEoBQtbS1zeKQ_g?e=YeRzvf)


### What Data Does this Project Use?

This project uses 3 categories of data:
 1. Nationwide Electricity and Emissions Data for India from [carbontracker.in](https://carbontracker.in/).
 2. Weather data from [ERA5-Land](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-land?tab=overview) and [ERA5](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview) for locations around Delhi and Mumbai.
 3. Proprietary electricity usage data from Tata customers in Delhi and Mumbai.

Note^ We use both ERA-5 Land and ERA5 global data in order to grab high resolution data for as many key variables as we can and then accept lower resolution data for additional variables or for filling gaps in the higher resolution dataset.

<br>


### Where is the data coming from?


The data used in this project is also being used in projects for the [Hitachi-Imperial Centre for Decarbonisation and Natural Climate Solutions](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/hitachi-centre/about-us/). The [Data Science Institute](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/data-science/) at Imperial, specifically Brython Caley-Davies, assisted in centralising much of the data into a locally hosted postgreSQL database.
As such the carbontracker, ERA5-Land, and customer electricity data is all accessed via this database.
The ERA5 global analysis was downloaded from the [Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview) website.

## Project Impact and Significance

**Why this project is relevant?**

The value of this work can be summarised into three key points:

1. **Filling a geographic gap.** High-quality marginal emissions and methods exist for North America/Europe, but are scarce elsewhere. This project provides location- and time-specific MEFs for Delhi and Mumbai, India, and a replicable path to extend them.

2. **Contributing to the literature.** It adds evidence for data-driven approaches to MEF estimation—showing that a lightweight, public-data specification (weather + demand/emissions with simple temporal controls) is reproducible while retaining reasonable accuracy.

3. **Turning estimates into action.** A constraint-aware, lightweight optimization module translates MEFs into practical load-shifting guidance:
    * *Realistic & efficient*: respects comfort/feasibility constraints and runs quickly without heavy compute.
    * *Actionable (not perfect)*: the greedy heuristic doesn’t guarantee a global optimum, but reliably finds useful local improvements that highlight low-disruption opportunities to cut CO₂.

<br>
In short, this work demonstrates a transparent, low-barrier pathway from public signals (weather, demand, emissions) to location- and time-specific marginal emissions and operational scheduling recommendations.
